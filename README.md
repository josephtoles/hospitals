Quantum Hospital
================

Summary
-------

Hospitals in the United States vary in price and quality greatly. For dangerous procedures such as surgery, choosing the right hospital can literally save your life. Unfortunately, patients have little information by which to go on. This project created a metric from which patients could measure the quality of different hospitals.

UPDATE: as of June 2015, the website associated with this project is no longer online

Use
---

Users logging into the website are shown a map of the hospitals located nearby along with three metrics: safety, price, and friendliness
 * safety: how likely a patient is to go through operations without complications or death
 * price: how expensive procedures tend to be
 * friendliness: averaged rating of subjective reviews by patients of hospital staff and facility

Implementation
--------------

This project is implemented as a Django server. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are implemented statically in the same project. Analytics, performed in R, are located in a different project
